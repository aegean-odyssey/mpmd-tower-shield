# mpmd tower shield

A barrier to keep debris from falling through the tower into the
Monoprice MP Mini Delta's inner workings. The idea comes directly
from thetrebor's "Monoprice Mini Delta V2 Shield" on Thingiverse
(https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2622002). I created the openscad
version here to allow me to adjust the shield's size for a better fit.

##### 3D PRINTING

Three (3) shields are required, one for each tower. Suggested parameters
for 3D printing:
```
layer height:        0.200mm
first layer height:  0.200mm
supports:	     not required
```

Supports are not required but a "brim" might be useful. The `mouse-ears.stl`
file contains tabs positioned on the ends of the shield as an alternative.
With PrusiaSlicer, simply add the mouse ears file as a "part" of the shield
model -- the ears will be positioned properly.
   
##### HOW TO USE

Snap a shield onto each tower of the printer. Push the shields down
onto the build area to form a barrier around the base of the towers.
